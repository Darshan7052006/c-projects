# TeenWalletCLI

A beginner-friendly, menu-driven C program that simulates a wallet system for teenagers.

## 🚀 Description

This program asks the user for their age and determines if they are a teenager (age 13–19). If eligible, it presents a menu with options to:

- Start investing (by adding money to a virtual wallet)
- Contact a financial consultant
- Exit the system

For non-teenagers, access is denied.

## 📋 Features

- Age-based access control
- Menu-driven options
- Dynamic user input with graceful exit
- Clean CLI interface using loops and conditions

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc teenwallet.c -o teenwallet
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./teenwallet
   ```

(Or run it using any C IDE like Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or Visual Studio Code.)

## 🧠 C Concepts Used

- `if-else` and nested conditions
- `while` loops
- `break` statements
- `scanf` and `printf` for input/output

## 📁 Status

✅ Completed — functional with basic logic.  
🚀 Future ideas: Add data persistence or graphical UI in Python or C++.
