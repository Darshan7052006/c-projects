Welcome to the **Guessing Game**, a simple console-based game written in the C programming language.

## ðŸ§  Description

The Guessing Game challenges the player to match a randomly generated number between 0 and 99. You are given a maximum of **7 chances** to guess the correct number. The game gives hints after each attemptâ€”whether your guess is too high or too low.

After winning (or exhausting all chances), the player can choose to **play again** or exit the game.

The game also awards titles based on performance:
- ðŸ¥‡ Guessed within 3 chances: **Super Duper NINJA!**
- ðŸ¥ˆ Guessed within 4-5 chances: **Crazy NINJA!**
- ðŸ¥‰ Guessed in 6-7 chances: **Potential NINJA!**
